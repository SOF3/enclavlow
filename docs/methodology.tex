\section{Methodology}\label{sec:methodology}
The main component of this project is the analysis framework,
which is conducted in the form of iterations
to fulfill security policies as specified in the integration tests.
Other parts such as Gradle plugin interfae,
although necessary for usage,
are not focus areas of this project, and hence will not be discussed further.

\subsection{System Requirements}\label{subsec:system-requirements}
The logical code of this project is mostly implemented in Kotlin,
a JVM language with more concise syntax than Java.
However, to ensure that he behaviour analyzed
is as explicit as possible,
all test cases are written in Java.

As Uranus was only tested against Linux systems,
this project does not intend to support other operating systems.
Furthermore, due to classpath detection difficulties,
only OpenJDK Version 8 and 11 are supported currently.
Nevertheless, since \pname{} is just a developer tool,
its runtime is actually independent of that targeted by Uranus,
so it is possible to test support for those frameworks in the future.

\pname{} is packaged as a Gradle plugin,
allowing developers to use it in projects with a Gradle toolchain.
However, the \code{enclavlow-core} subproject can be reused in other contexts,
such as Maven plugins, IDE plugins, etc.

\subsection{Flow analysis framework}\label{subsec:flow-analysis-framework}
Soot~\cite{sootsurvivor} was selected as the framework for conducting flow analysis.
Although multiple existing flow analysis systems using Soot alrady exist,
they are not designed against SGX enclave protection,
but \pname{} adopts more strict security policies
to prevent attacks from more privileged attackers,
unlike traditional information flow analysis
that mostly detects user input as the source of insecurity.

Soot takes Java bytecode files (\code{*.class}) as input
and compiles them into a 3AC language called Jimple,
which simplifies analysis work.
The consume-branch-merge approach mentioned in the last subsection
was inspired by the forward flow analysis interface in Jimple.

Other flow analysis frameworks were also considered,
such as Joana~\cite{joana} and JFlow~\cite{jflow}.
Soot was chosen due to its distinctively thorough documentation
and builtin support for call graph analysis.

\subsection{Testing}\label{subsec:testing}
This project uses JUnit 5 and \code{kotlin.test} framework
to conduct both unit and integration tests.
Test case classes are compiled together in the \code{:core:testClasses} task,
which declares dependency on the APIs \code{sourceMarker} and \code{sinkMarker}.
