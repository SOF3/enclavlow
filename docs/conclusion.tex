\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
This project aims to develop a \ac{JVM} code analysis tool
for software using Uranus for \ac{SGX} applications
to assist the choice of enclave boundaries.
A divide-and-conquer approach was adopted for
efficient abstraction of information flow across a method.
Since the project delivers an analysis tool
but leaves the decision right to the user,
a higher tolerance for false positives was accepted.

To formalize the behaviour of false positives with the project,
analysis is to be conducted on the occurrence of false positives.
Usability of the tool with common libraries in the Java ecosystem will be assessed.
With sufficient theoretical background to support the correctness of the algorithms,
this tool is expected to serve as an auxiliary quality control integration
for open source projects that may see demand in the big data industry
and other confidential data processing applications.
